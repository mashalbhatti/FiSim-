# FiSim - Entended 

FiSim is an open-source deterministic fault attack simulator prototype for exploring the effects of fault injection attacks based on the Unicorn Framework and the Capstone disassembler. By simulating faults given one or more fault models, it is possible to explore the effects of these attacks and test the effectiveness of countermeasures. Additionally, it is possible to plan and simulate a specific attack (i.e. the attack payload, etc.) to see whether it will be succesfull or not. 
This repository contains the extended version of FiSim, which was developed for a research internship.
